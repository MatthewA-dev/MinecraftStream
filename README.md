# MinecraftStream
Plugin with server that streams your desktop to a minecraft world


Plugin is under the MinecraftStream folder and the server is server.py.

When running compiling, you will need to make a few modifications to the rapidoid library files, these are provided, since there is a rare NullPointerException that is thrown when running from Spigot. 

When in minecraft, run /startserver and it'll start the server, and you can run server.py to start streaming.

Kinda scuffed at the moment, but it does what I want it to do. Maybe someone better could make it run faster and make the colors more accurate.
